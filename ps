ps is the process status command. It allows you to see what processes you have launched. If you run ps in your terminal
you will see what processes you have running, there will always be a bash file as this loads things like your env. If you
have more than one terminal open you will get several bash files shown when you run ps. You can aslo use the command ps x 
to show all processes on your computer.
